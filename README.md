# My personal dotfiles
My collection of dotfiles. These dotfiles are managed by [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) tools. In the bin directory 
you will find shortcut scripts to make work with this repository easier.

# How to
To add something to this repository you can use these scripts:

```
  ./bin/lsrc
  ./bin/mkrc
  ./bin/rsup
  ./bin/rsdn
```

To set all the dotfiles to their place just write `./bin/rcup`. To add a new rcfile use `./bin/mkrc`. For more information please see
`man rcm`.
